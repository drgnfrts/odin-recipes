    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Egg-battered toast with cinnamon sugar flavours, a classic breakfast dish when you're feeling something Western in the morning. As listed from <a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/classic-french-toast/">Tastes Better from Scratch</a></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F or or heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add all ingredients, except the bread, to a blender or to a shallow dish and whisk well to combine. If whisking by hand, mix flour and eggs together first, then add remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Dip bread slices into the batter, dredging them well on both sides, and place on hot, greased griddle or skillet.</li>
            <li>Cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the breads starts to get golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side the same. </li>
